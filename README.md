1. Download the code or clone the repository.

    [PSD file for Mobile Layout](https://t.me/abhishek_fork/3), 
    [PSD file for Widescreen Layout](https://t.me/abhishek_fork/2), 
    [Font Files](https://t.me/abhishek_fork/4)
3. Install the fonts to your computer.
4. **"One1"** includes widescreen layouts and **"OneM1"** includes layout for Mobile devices.
5. Open the PSD files and replace the photos with your friend's photos.
6. Name the exported images accordingly. Pictures exported from "One1" should be name **"##BG" and "##FG"**. e.g. "01BG". And the images exported from "OneM1" should be named **"##MBG" and "##MFG"**. e.g. "01MFG".
7. Disable the background layer in each folder and export the image named "01FG" for folder "one".
8. Disable the foreground layer and enable the background layer and export as "01BG" for folder "one".
9. Do the same for each folder in both PSD files.
10. Now you should have 36 pictures named **"01BG", "01FG", "01MBG", "01MFG"**...
11. You need to convert all the files to webp format. Use [This](https://webp-converter.com/) to convert pictures to webp.
12. Move the converted pictures to img folder and replace the ones that are already in the folder.

### A little typing part
Open the **auth.js** file in **js** folder and change the username and password combo to whatever you want.
If you don't want visitors to require passwords just delete the index.html file and rename here.html to index.html
